# UPGRADE-PYTHON-PROJ

PROBLEM STATEMENT:::-

Have you ever heard the proverb, "finding a needle in a
haystack," This program is designed to do just that- by
using a binary search algorithm.
This python project idea will help you create and
implement an algorithm that searches for an element
in a list.
In a nutshell, this search algorithm takes advantage of
a collection of elements that is already sorted by
ignoring half of the elements after just one
comparison.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:::-

You have to create a list of random numbers between O to 100, with
every succeeding number having a difference Of 2 between them.
When the user inputs a random number, the program will check if
that number is included in the list. It will do so by creating two
halves of the list.
If the program finds the number in the first half Of the list, it Will
eliminate the other half and vice versa.
The search will continue until the program finds the number input
of the user or until the subarray size becomes O (this means that the
number is not in the list).
